# matlab-figure-handles


- Do all the following in a script named ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒.𝑚
- First, make a variable x that goes from 0 to 2𝜋 , and then make 𝑦 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥).
- Make a new 𝑓𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑟𝑒 and do 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑡(𝑥,𝑦,’𝑟’)
- Set the x limit to go from 0 to 2𝜋 (xlim)
- Set the 𝑥𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘 property of the axis to be just the values [0  𝑝𝑖  2 ∗ 𝑝𝑖] and set 𝑥𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙 to be {‘0’, ’1’, ’2’}. Use set and gca
- Set the 𝑦𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘 property of the axis to be just the values −1: 0.5: 1. Use 𝒔𝒆𝒕 and 𝒈𝒄𝒂
- Turn on the grid by doing 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑜𝑛.
- Set the 𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 property of the axis to green, the 𝑥𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 property to cyan, and the 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 property to black (use set and gca)
- Set the 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 property of the figure to a dark gray.Use set and gcf
- Add a title that says ‘One sine wave from 0 to 2π’ with 𝑓𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 14, 𝑓𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 bold,and 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 white. Hint: to get the π to display properly, use \pi in your string. MATLAB uses a Tex or Latex interpreter in xlabel, ylabel, and title. You can do all this just by using 
title, no need for handles.
- Add the appropriate x and y labels (make sure the π shows up that way in the x label) using a 𝑓𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 of 12 and 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 cyan for x and green for y. Use xlabel and ylabel ␣␣
